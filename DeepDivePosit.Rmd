## Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the \*Run\* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing \*Ctrl+Shift+Enter\*.

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Ok that is a standard dataset that does not mean much.
The mtcars dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains measurements on 11 different attributes for 32 different cars.

So let's see some thinking more interesting!

# Our Dataset

The Statistical Accounts of Scotland are a series of documentary publications, related in subject matter though published at different times, covering life in Scotland in the 18th and 19th.

The Old (or First) Statistical Account of Scotland was published between 1791 and 1799 by Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster.
The New (or Second) Statistical Account of Scotland published under the auspices of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland between 1834 and 1845.
These first two Statistical Accounts of Scotland are unique records of life during the agricultural and industrial revolutions in Europe.

## Structure of the dataset

The original publication has been scanned and OCRed and each single record has been collected in a .txt file.
The name of each file contain information about the document itself.
For example StAS.2.15.91.P.Orkney.Cross_and_Burness

-   StAs.2.15.91 -\> Second Statistical Account

-   P -\> Parish (Contain information from the Parish)

-   Orkney -\> Area of interest (Scotland has been divided in 33 Areas)

-   Cross_and_Burness -\> Parish

We are going to see how to use this to extract information about all our text later but the first thing we need to do is to create a single dataframe (table) that will contain all the texts otherwise it will be very difficult to manage the data.

## Prepare the dataset

All our .txt files are in a directory named Account so I can write a function that will loop through each of the files extract the text and the tile of each file and put them all in a table.

Doing it manually would take a ridiculous amount of time but that is what computer are for so let's see what we can do.

1\.
Create a new object that contain the path to our directory

```{r set directory}
text_files_dir <- "Accounts"
```

2.  Create an empty data.table that we are going to populate with the info we are going to extract

```{r create new table}
text_files <- list.files(text_files_dir, pattern = "\\.txt$", full.names = TRUE)#search for .txt

Scotdata <- data.table(title = character(), text = character())# create a table with two column one named title and one text
```

3.  Iterate through each text file We do this by using a forloop function

```{r populate table}
for (file in text_files) {
  # Specify the encoding (e.g., "latin1")
  text <- tolower(iconv(readLines(file, warn = FALSE), from = "latin1", to = "UTF-8", sub = ""))# tolower gets all text low cap 
  title <- gsub(".txt$", "", basename(file))# gsub extracts the pattern define so the tile of the files before .txt
  Scotdata <- rbindlist(list(Scotdata, data.table(title = title, text = paste(text, collapse = " "))))# bind them together
}
```

4.  look at the first 5 row of our file and save the table as a .csv so I do not have to do it every single time

```{r check result}
head(Scotdata)
write.csv(Scotdata, "text_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Clean and format the data

### Fix some formatting issues

Fix the going to the next line issue.
i.e. sub "- " with nothing "" There are a lot of formatting errors (next line, next paragraph) that we want to clean up

```{r Clean data}
ScotdataClean <- mutate_if(Scotdata, 
                           is.character, #apply the changes only if the data is a "character" type (e.g. text)
                           str_replace_all, 
                           pattern = "-[[:space:]]+","") #What I am searching for+ what I am subbing with. -[[:space:]]+ matches a hyphen followed by one or more whitespace characters. For example, it would match strings like "- " (hyphen followed by a space) or "- " (hyphen followed by multiple spaces). 
```

### Extract More info from the dataset

To do the following steps we are using regex.
Short for regular expression, a regex is a string of text that lets you create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.
Think find and replace in Word

1.  Extract area and parish from the title

-   P=Parish
-   C=Miscellanea
-   G=General Observations
-   A=Appendix
-   F=General
-   I=Index
-   M=Map

I want to be able to subset the dataset by those and I also want to have them both as a code as a description to do so I need to write a if else clause

```{r Extract type Info from Titles}
ScotdataClean$Type<- sub(".*(P|C|G|A|F|M|I)\\.(.*?)\\..*", "\\1", ScotdataClean$title)#This is selecting the P|C|G|A|F|M|I
ScotdataClean$TypeDescriptive<- ifelse(
  ScotdataClean$Type =="P", "Parish",ifelse(
    ScotdataClean$Type =="C","Miscellanea", ifelse(
      ScotdataClean$Type =="G","General Observations", ifelse(
        ScotdataClean$Type =="A", "Appendix", ifelse(
          ScotdataClean$Type =="F","General", ifelse(
            ScotdataClean$Type =="I", "Index","Map"))))))
```

2.  I want the first bit of the title as the RecordId of the document

```{r Extract record ID from Titles}
ScotdataClean$RecordID<- sub("^(StAS\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+).*","\\1",  ScotdataClean$title)
```

3.  I also want to extract the area that is the bit after p/c/g/a/f/m/i

```{r Extract area from Titles}
ScotdataClean$Area<- sub(".*(P|C|G|A|F|M|I)\\.(.*?)\\..*", "\\2", ScotdataClean$title)# //2 cause I want to select the second bit so after the letters
```

4.  Extract the Parish. I can do so by extracting the last bit up until the full stop

```{r Extract parish from Titles}
ScotdataClean$Parish<- sub(".*\\.", "", ScotdataClean$title)
```

### Subset the dataset to only keep the text with information from the parishes

We will now start to look at what is inside but before starting our analysis we want to work only on the parish observations since a lot of the other documents are part of indexes or summaries

```{r extract parish data}
Parish<-subset(ScotdataClean, Type =="P")

write_csv(Parish, "Parish.csv")
```

# Explore the dataset created

Create a Quanteda corpus of the 'text' column from our data set A corpus class object containing the original texts, document-level variables, document-level metadata, corpus-level metadata, and default settings for subsequent processing of the corpus.
For quanteda \>= 2.0, this is a specially classed character vector.

```{r Quanteda corpus}
CorpusStat<-corpus(Parish$text)
```

## Summarise the content of the corpus

Print doc in position 5 of the corpus

```{r Overview Corpus}
summary(CorpusStat, 5)
```

Check how many docs are in the corpus

```{r number docs}
ndoc(CorpusStat) 
```

Check number of characters in the first 10 documents of the corpus

```{r number carachters for first 10 text }
nchar(CorpusStat[1:10])
```

# Part2: Geographical Data

Since our data are all connected with places in Scotland we can look at topics within our dataset and how popular they are in different areas of Scotland.

To do so we need to work with a geoPackage containing the same information about the areas of Scotland contained in the dataset.
GeoPackage is an open, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geo-spatial information.
In our case it is a vectorial representation of the areas of Scotland in which the accounts are subdivided.

Look at what is inside our dataset

```{r summary dataset}
summary(Parish)
```

### Import the Geographical Data

Then we import the first GeoPackage.
A GeoPackage is an open, standards-based format designed for the efficient storage, transfer, and exchange of geospatial data.
Developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), it serves as a container for various types of geospatial information, including vector features, raster maps, and attribute data, all within a single file <https://www.geopackage.org/>.

st_read Function: \* from st package that reads vector spatial data.
\* dsn = data source name, essentially the file name and the folder path

```{r Gpkg1, warning=FALSE}
ParishesGeo <- st_read(dsn = "Spatial/Parishes.gpkg")
plot(ParishesGeo, main = "Scottish Parishes")
```

As you can see from the plot, the dataset is made up of vector polygons.
You can also change the basic presentation, such as the colour of the fill, line width and colour.

```{r Gpkg2 }
plot(ParishesGeo,
     col = "black",
     lwd = 1,
     border = "white",
     main = "Scottish Parishes")
```

## Work on Illness Mentions

### Extract Information from the textual data

Because we want to see how often mention of a certain topic are present in the text we want to search for specific keywords

The first topic we are going to look at is Illness.
So we are creating a new variable that would contain yes if the text contains one of the keywords or no if it does not

1.Search keywords

```{r }
Parish$Ilness<- ifelse(grepl("ill|ilness|sick|cholera|smallpox|plague|cough|typhoid|fever|measles|dysentery", Parish$text,
                             ignore.case = T), "yes","no")

head(Parish$Ilness)
```

2.  Group by Illness and geographical area

To do this we use a pipe, if you have never seen a pipe before is basically a way to perform a series of action on a dataset in a certain order (you can think at it as bullet points of actions)

```{r }
IlnessGroup <- Parish %>%
  group_by(Area) %>%
  summarise(Total = n(),
            count = sum(Ilness == "yes")) %>%
  mutate(per = round(count/Total, 2))

head(IlnessGroup)
```

3.Merge the two datasets

```{r }
MergedGeo <-merge(ParishesGeo,IlnessGroup,
                  by.x="JOIN_NAME_",
                  by.y="Area",
                  all.x = TRUE) # nb this is left join cause I want to preserve all the records present in ParishGeo

```

4.Check data to have merged properly

```{r }
head(MergedGeo, max.level = 2)
```

### Visualise the new dataset

1.Create a continuous color palette

```{r }
color.palette <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "red"))
```

2.  Spatial plot using tmap

tm_shape is a function in the tmap package (Thematic maps).
Thematic maps can be generated with great flexibility.
The syntax for creating plots is similar to that of ggplot2, but tailored to maps.
To plot a tmap, you will need to specify firstly tm_shape, layers then can be added with the + operator.
tm_fill specifies the presentation of the polygons.
To differentiate NA values from other valid entries, colorNA is added.

-   col.regions = color.palette(100): specifies the colour to fill the polygon, now set to generate a palette with 100 distinct colours.

```{r }

tm_shape(MergedGeo) + # Specify the spatial object (MergedGeo) to be used in the map
  tm_fill("per", palette = color.palette(100), colorNA = "grey") + # Fill polygons based on 'per' variable, using a custom color palette with 100 colors; grey for NA values
  tm_borders(col = "black") + # Add black borders to each polygon
  tm_layout(title = "Illness report", legend.text.size = 0.75, legend.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE) # Set layout: add a title, resize legend text and title, remove frame


```

### Work with map colours

Let's try changing the colour of the filled regions using predifined colours.
There are predifined colour palettes you can use directly.
Commonly used palettes include: rainbow(), heat.colors(), topo.colors(), and terrain.colors() Beware of the representation of colours.
You might need to reverse the colour band to make the representations more intuitive.

```{r }
tm_shape(MergedGeo) + # Specify the spatial object (MergedGeo) to be used in the map
  tm_fill("per", palette = rev(heat.colors(100)), colorNA = "grey") + # Fill polygons based on 'per' variable, using a reversed heat.colors palette with 100 colors; grey for NA values
  tm_borders(col = "black") + # Add black borders to each polygon
  tm_layout(title = "Illness report", legend.text.size = 0.75, legend.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE) # Set layout: add a title, resize legend text and title, remove frame

```

You could also change the colour using RColorBrewer

```{r }

display.brewer.all()# show all the palettes in Colour brewer
color.palette <- brewer.pal(n = 9, name = "YlOrRd")#create a tailored new palette
```

We can now replot using the new palette.

```{r }
tm_shape(MergedGeo) + # Specify the spatial object (MergedGeo) to be used in the map
  tm_fill("per", palette = color.palette, colorNA = "grey") + # Fill polygons based on 'per' variable, using a custom color palette (color.palette); grey for NA values
  tm_borders(col = "black") + # Add black borders to each polygon
  tm_layout(title = "Illness report", legend.text.size = 0.75, legend.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE) # Set layout: add a title, resize legend text and title, remove frame


```

### Work on the legend intervals

Change the spacing of the interval.
The intervals can be keyed in directly using and style to change the type of breaks

1\.
"fixed": User-defined fixed breaks.

2\.
"pretty": Breaks at pretty intervals (often used for visual appeal).

3\.
"quantile": Breaks at quantile intervals (each class has an equal number of observations).

4\.
"equal": Breaks at equal intervals.

5\.
"kmeans": Breaks determined by k-means clustering.

6\.
"hclust": Breaks determined by hierarchical clustering.

7\.
"bclust": Breaks determined by bin-based clustering.

8\.
"fisher": Breaks determined by Fisher-Jenks natural breaks optimization.

9\.
"jenks": Another name for Fisher-Jenks breaks.

10\.
"sd": Breaks determined by standard deviations from the mean.

11\.
"log10_pretty": Breaks determined by log10 transformed values with pretty intervals.

12\.
"cont": Continuous color scale (no discrete breaks).

```{r }
tm_shape(MergedGeo) + # Specify the spatial object (MergedGeo) to be used in the map
  tm_fill("per", style = "equal", n = 10, palette = color.palette, colorNA = "grey") + # Fill polygons based on 'per' variable; use equal interval classification with 10 classes; custom color palette; grey for NA values
  tm_borders(col = "black") + # Add black borders to each polygon
  tm_layout(title = "Illness report", legend.text.size = 0.75, legend.title.size = 1, frame = FALSE, legend.position = c(1, 0.5)) # Set layout: add a title, resize legend text and title, remove frame, position legend at (1, 0.5)

```

## Now we can work on a different subject: Witches

The steps are always the same first we need to search keywords and then we merge the results with our map of Scotland.

### Preparing the data set

```{r }
Parish$witches<- ifelse(grepl("witch|spell|witches|enchantemt|magic", Parish$text, ignore.case = T), "yes","no")
```

Can you think to other keywords?
just add them to the code above.

Then we group by

```{r }
WitchGroup <- Parish %>%
  group_by(Area) %>%
  summarise(Total = n(), count = sum(witches == "yes")) %>%
  mutate(per = round(count / Total, 2))

```

And finally we merge

```{r }
MergedGeo2 <-merge(ParishesGeo,WitchGroup, by.x="JOIN_NAME_", by.y="Area", all.x = TRUE) # nb this is left join cause I want to preserve all the records present in ParishGeo
```

Let's create a more "witchy" Palette

```{r }
color.palette2 <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "purple"), alpha = 0.5)
```

### Plot the result

```{r }
tm_shape(MergedGeo2) +
  tm_fill("per", palette = color.palette2(100), colorNA = "grey") +
  tm_borders(col = "black")+
  tm_layout(title = "Witchcraft report",
            legend.text.size = 0.75,
            legend.title.size = 1,
            frame = FALSE)

```

### Refine the results:Adding scale bar and north arrow

Adding the scale bar and north arrow to the map using tmap is a lot simpler.

```{r }
tm_shape(MergedGeo2) +
  tm_fill("per",
          style = "equal",
          n = 5,
          palette = color.palette2(100),
          colorNA = "grey") +
  tm_borders(col = "black")+
  tm_layout(title = "Witches Reports",
            legend.text.size = 0.75,
            legend.title.size = 1,
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = "left") + #add scalebar
  tm_compass(size = 1.5)#add north arrow
```

## Whiski consumption

Let's connect back to the one of the main topics of this week and look at whiski consumption across Scotland.

Unsurprisingly the first steps remain the same.

1.  Search the keywords

```{r }
Parish$Booze<- ifelse(grepl("illicit still|illicit distillery|drunk|intemperance|wisky|whisky|whiskey|whysky |alembic",Parish$text, ignore.case = T), "yes","no")
```

2.  Group by the new column and area

```{r }
BoozeGroup <- Parish %>%
  group_by(Area) %>%
  summarise(Total = n(), count = sum(Booze == "yes")) %>%
  mutate(per = round(count / Total, 2))

```

3.  Merge back

```{r }
MergedGeo3 <-merge(ParishesGeo,BoozeGroup, by.x="JOIN_NAME_", by.y="Area",all.x = TRUE) # nb this is left join cause I want to preserve all the records present in ParishGeo

```

4.  Create a Palette

```{r }
color.palette3 <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "Brown"))

```

5.  Plot with tmap

```{r }
tm_shape(MergedGeo3) +
  tm_fill("per",
          style = "equal",
          n = 5,
          palette = color.palette3(100),
          colorNA = "grey") +
  tm_borders(col = "black")+
  tm_layout(title = "Whisky Reports",
            legend.text.size = 0.75,
            legend.title.size = 1,
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = "left") +
  tm_compass(size = 1.5)

```

### Work with multiple datasets

Add the second dataset i.e. the punctual dataset with the location of the modern day distilleries.

```{r}
PointsDistilleries<- st_read(dsn = "Spatial/ScottishDistilleries.gpkg")
```

```{r }

tm_shape(MergedGeo3) +
  tm_fill("per",
          style = "equal",
          n = 5,
          palette = color.palette3(100),
          colorNA = "grey") +
  tm_borders(col = "black")+
  tm_layout(title = "Whisky Reports",
            legend.text.size = 0.75,
            legend.title.size = 1,
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = "left") +
  tm_compass(size = 1.5)+
  tm_shape(PointsDistilleries) + # we add our new datest
  tm_dots(size=0.1,
          col="black", #This time they are dots rather than fill
          colorNA = NULL)

```

We can also use bespoke symbols for distilleries locations and plot it again.

```{r }
icon <- tmap_icons("bottle.png") 

tm_shape(MergedGeo3) + 
  # Fill the polygons based on the "per" attribute
  tm_fill("per", 
          style = "equal",  # Use equal interval breaks
          n = 5,  # Number of classes to divide the data into
          palette = color.palette3(100),  # Color palette with 100 color levels
          colorNA = "grey") +  # Color for missing values
  # Add borders to the polygons
  tm_borders(col = "black") +
  # Add another spatial object to the map
  tm_shape(PointsDistilleries) +
  # Add symbols (icons) for the spatial points
  tm_symbols(size = 0.3, # Size of the symbols
             clustering = TRUE,
             shape = icon,# Symbol shape (specified by the 'icon' variable)
             border.lwd = 0,) +   # Border width of the symbols 
  # Add layout elements like title and legend settings
  tm_layout(title = "Booze Reports",  # Title of the map
            legend.text.size = 0.75,  # Size of the legend text
            legend.title.size = 1,  # Size of the legend title
            frame = FALSE) +  # Do not draw a frame around the map
  # Add a scale bar to the map
  tm_scale_bar(position = "left") +  # Position of the scale bar
  # Add a compass to the map
  tm_compass(size = 1.5)  # Size of the compass
```
